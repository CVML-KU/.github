## 🩺 Medical Imaging  

We develop advanced computer vision and machine learning methods for the analysis of diverse medical imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, X-ray, fundus, and digital pathology. Our work aims to build robust computational frameworks that enhance diagnostic accuracy, support quantitative interpretation, and improve clinical decision-making across healthcare applications.
